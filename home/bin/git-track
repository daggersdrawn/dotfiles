## Usage: git track
##        git track <branch>
## Point the current local branch at <branch> for the purpose
## of merge tracking, pull, and status features. With no <branch>,
## write the currently tracked branch to standard output.
##
## If you have git's bash-completion support enabled, add this:
## complete -o default -o nospace -F _git_checkout git-track
